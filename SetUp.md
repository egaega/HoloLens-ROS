## Check PC spec
### 1.CPU, GPU, BIOS spec
The HoloLens emulator is based on Hyper-V and uses RemoteFx for hardware accelerated graphics. 
#### To use the emulator, make sure your PC meets these hardware requirements: Â 
  * 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education (The Home edition does not support Hyper-V or the HoloLens emulator)  
  * 64-bit CPU  
  * CPU with 4 cores (or multiple CPU's with a total of 4 cores)  
  * 8 GB of RAM or more  
#### In the BIOS, the following features must be supported and enabled:  
  * Hardware-assisted virtualization  
  * Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)  
  * Hardware-based Data Execution Prevention (DEP)  
#### GPU (The emulator might work with an unsupported GPU, but will be significantly slower)  
  * DirectX 11.0 or later  
  * WDDM 1.2 driver or later
  
If your system meets the above requirements, please ensure that the "Hyper-V" feature has been enabled on your system through Control Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows Features on or off -> ensure that "Hyper-V" is selected for the Emulator installation to be successful.
